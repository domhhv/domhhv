### Hi! I'm Dominik 👋

I'm a full-stack JavaScript developer building web applications with usability in mind.

My main tech stack includes TypeScript, React, TailwindCSS, Next.js, Node.js, Express, NestJS, PostgreSQL, Supabase, TypeORM, Lexical, and more.

I've also worked with AI/LLM APIs, like those of OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, and Perplexity, and SDKs such as Vercel AI SDK.

I've contributed to the decentralized web at Unstoppable Domains and Akash Network, most notably:

- independently bootstrapped [unstoppable-domains/UI-Kit](https://github.com/unstoppabledomains/UI-Kit) as a public npm package, establishing all the docs and build pipelines
- delivered [console/issues/1348](https://github.com/akash-network/console/issues/1348) end-to-end – deployment usage analytics and Stripe transactions dashboard feature

I've also built internal tools at Waze (Google), acted as a founding sole engineer at an early-stage, AI-driven startup Neurohive, and worked across various companies and international teams (American, German, Israeli) over the past 10 years.

Current personal projects:

- 🔃 **[Habitrack](https://github.com/domhhv/habitrack)** | [habitrack.io](habitrack.io) – _a calendar habit-tracking SPA_
- ⌨️ **[Textual](https://github.com/domhhv/textual)** | [textual.chat](textual.chat) – _rich-text editor with AI-assisted writing (BYOK)_
- 📊 **[Emailcompat](https://github.com/domhhv/emailcompat)** | [emailcompat.dev](emailcompat.dev) – _HTML email rendering compatibility report across email clients_

I'm actively considering new opportunities. My ideal next role would bring about an autonomous environment and async culture where I can strengthen my sense of ownership and build impactful tools and products.

_Let's connect!_
