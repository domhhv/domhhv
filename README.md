### Hi! I'm Dominik ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full-Stack Engineer, formerly at Waze and Unstoppable Domains.

Currently building an AI solution for designing data centers and learning a ton about LLMs.

I develop JavaScript apps, both client-side and server-side. I'm also working to understand clouds and networks more deeply.

In the last nine years, I have gained proficiency in TypeScript, React, Node.js, SQL, and many other technologies.
